MWA!</p>
        <p>Your unwavering dedication and the way you match your words with your actions fill my heart with an indescribable warmth. 
            It's in the little things you do—those thoughtful gestures, the way you anticipate my needs before I even voice them, and the countless ways you show up for me each day—that I find my greatest source of joy.</p>
        <p>My comfort in this world has deepened since you came bibi, and you're one of those people who made my life easier aning cruel na kalibotan. CHAR HAHAHAHAH! Pero bitaw, although we had fights na before, all I can say is that your love still remains steadfast despite the chaos.  ezes wala lang kay maldita man kaayo ko. mwhe </p>
       <p>Thank you for being the embodiment of love in its purest form—for showing me each day what it means to love and be loved. 
          I cherish you more than words can express, and I am eternally grateful for the love that we share bibi.</p>
        <p>Forever and always, I will cherish you. For you are not just my partner, but my everything.</p>
        <p>Yours always,</p>
